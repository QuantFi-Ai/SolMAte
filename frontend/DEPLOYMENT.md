# SOLM8 Frontend Deployment Guide

## Overview
This is the production-ready frontend for SOLM8 5.0, optimized for deployment on Kubernetes with zero dependency conflicts.

## Key Optimizations Applied

### 1. **Dependency Cleanup**
- Removed all Solana wallet adapter dependencies (not used in current app)
- Eliminated React Native dependencies causing conflicts
- Streamlined to essential packages only

### 2. **Version Locking**
- All dependencies use exact versions (no ^ or ~ prefixes)
- Prevents version conflicts during deployment
- Ensures consistent builds across environments

### 3. **Build Optimizations**
- Source maps disabled for production (`GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false`)
- ESLint disabled during build (`DISABLE_ESLINT_PLUGIN=true`)
- Optimized webpack configuration for production

### 4. **Cache Prevention**
- Preinstall script clears node_modules and lock files
- Custom .npmrc and .yarnrc configurations
- Prevents deployment caching issues

## Build Commands

### Standard Build
```bash
yarn build
```

### Clean Build (recommended for deployment)
```bash
./build.sh
```

## Environment Variables
- `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL`: https://solm8-tinder.emergent.host
- `NODE_ENV`: production
- `CI`: true
- `DISABLE_ESLINT_PLUGIN`: true
- `GENERATE_SOURCEMAP`: false

## Bundle Size
- **JavaScript**: ~118 KB (gzipped)
- **CSS**: ~8.5 KB (gzipped)
- **Total**: ~126.5 KB (gzipped)

## Deployment Status
âœ… **Ready for Production Deployment**
- All peer dependency conflicts resolved
- Build process optimized
- Environment variables configured
- Zero critical warnings

## Dependencies
All dependencies are locked to specific versions to prevent deployment conflicts. The app uses:
- React 18.2.0
- React Scripts 5.0.1
- Framer Motion for animations
- React Router for navigation
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Troubleshooting
If deployment fails:
1. Check that all dependencies are installed with exact versions
2. Clear node_modules and yarn.lock before building
3. Ensure environment variables are set correctly
4. Run `./build.sh` for a clean build
