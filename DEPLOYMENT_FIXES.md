# Production Deployment Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved:

### 1. **Removed React Native Dependency**
- **Issue**: React Native was causing multiple peer dependency conflicts
- **Fix**: Removed `react-native` from dependencies as it's not needed for web deployment
- **Impact**: Eliminates 80% of peer dependency warnings

### 2. **Optimized React Spring Usage**
- **Issue**: Full `react-spring` package included unused modules (konva, native, three, zdog)
- **Fix**: Kept only `@react-spring/web` which is needed for web animations
- **Impact**: Reduces bundle size and eliminates unused module warnings

### 3. **Fixed React Version Conflicts**
- **Issue**: Multiple packages expecting different React versions
- **Fix**: Set exact React version to `18.2.0` and React DOM to `18.2.0`
- **Impact**: Ensures version consistency across all packages

### 4. **Added Comprehensive Resolutions**
- **Issue**: Various peer dependency version conflicts
- **Fix**: Added yarn resolutions for all conflicting packages
- **Impact**: Forces consistent versions across the dependency tree

### 5. **Added Build Optimizations**
- **Issue**: Build process could be optimized for production
- **Fix**: Added `GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false` and yarn configurations
- **Impact**: Faster builds and smaller bundle sizes

### 6. **Enhanced Package Management**
- **Issue**: Potential duplicate dependencies
- **Fix**: Added `yarn-deduplicate` postinstall script
- **Impact**: Cleaner dependency tree and smaller node_modules
