The previous AI engineer successfully brought the SOLM8 BETA application from MVP to a more feature-rich state. The work began with a thorough environment setup and codebase exploration. The key additions include a comprehensive animation and micro-interaction system, a robust referral and support system (both backend and frontend), and significant bug fixes related to UI rendering, data access, and navigation. Repeated issues with Loading traders... and incorrect data display were meticulously debugged and resolved by iterating on frontend logic and backend data verification. The engineer also refined profile sharing and menu navigation, culminating in the implementation of a Public Profile modal. The last reported issue is a  reference error, indicating a minor cleanup or renaming issue from the recent modal implementation. The engineer's approach involved incremental development, extensive use of testing tools, and iterative debugging with user feedback.

The user's core requirement was to enhance the SOLM8 BETA application, a crypto trading social dating app that connects Solana traders. The application was already functional with a FastAPI backend, React frontend, and MongoDB database, featuring advanced user profiles, an AI-powered matching algorithm, discovery and matching system, real-time messaging, and basic trading features.

The explicit requests and implemented enhancements included:
1.  **Advanced Animations and Micro-interactions**: To make the UI more polished and modern.
2.  **Support Option and Referral System**: To allow users to generate referral links for organic growth and provide a direct channel for support.
3.  **Fixing Loading traders... issue**: To ensure correct display of discovery cards and appropriate messages when no traders are available.
4.  **Fixing Unknown User in Messages/Matches**: To correctly display user names and avatars.
5.  **Fixing Preview Profile and Share on Twitter**: To ensure these functions work and integrate affiliate links.
6.  **Profile Menu Cleanup**: To remove Preview Profile and Share on Twitter options, rename Profile Settings to Public Profile.
7.  **Public Profile as a popup**: To revert the Public Profile button's behavior from opening a new tab to a modal popup.
8.  **Remove Like sent popup**: To streamline the swipe experience.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack structure with distinct backend and frontend directories.



**Key Files and Changes:**

-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary**: The core FastAPI application handling all backend logic, API endpoints, and MongoDB interactions.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Added new API endpoints for the referral system: , , .
        -   Updated  to accept and process referral codes, ensuring proper tracking and attribution.
        -   Includes logic for user management, matching algorithms, and messaging.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary**: The main React component that orchestrates the entire application's UI, state management, and API calls. Most significant frontend changes happen here.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   **Animation Integration**: Modified numerous UI sections (login, navigation, discovery cards, messaging, match celebration) to use components from  and apply advanced Tailwind CSS animations.

        -   **Bug Fix - Loading traders...**: Implemented  and  states. Modified UI logic to show No traders available right now when data fetching is complete but no users are returned (due to all being swiped on).
        -   **Bug Fix - Like sent!**: Removed the toast notification for simple like actions.
        -   **Bug Fix - Public Profile Button**: Initially set to open a new tab. Later, changed to open the  component, and updated the menu entry's  handler and icon accordingly.

<pending_tasks>
-   The  error in  when navigating to certain views (likely related to profile popups) needs to be resolved.
-   Potential need for a Settings option in the profile menu if user wants separate access to profile management, as Public Profile now points to the viewing modal.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was working on fixing an error reported by the user: Uncaught runtime errors: ERROR showProfilePopup is not defined. This error occurred after the successful implementation of the Public Profile Modal, which aimed to replace the previous behavior of opening a new tab for profile preview with an in-app popup.

The error indicates a reference to a function or variable named  that is no longer defined or accessible in the current scope, likely a leftover from previous iterations of the profile display logic or a mis-refactored call within . The last action recorded was the AI engineer identifying the error and planning to find and fix this missing reference. The current state is that the Public Profile Modal has been created and integrated, and the Public Profile button in the menu now correctly attempts to open this modal, but a JavaScript error prevents it from fully rendering or functioning due to this undefined reference.
