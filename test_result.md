    message: "Completed in-depth investigation of discovery issues. The backend discovery system is working correctly. Database analysis shows 331 total users (8 email, 3 wallet, 0 twitter, 52 demo, 268 with no auth_method). 306 users have complete profiles. All users with complete profiles have the required fields (trading_experience, preferred_tokens, trading_style, portfolio_size). Created new email users and verified they can discover each other immediately after profile completion. Both regular discovery and AI recommendations are returning results correctly. The sorting by last_activity is working as expected. No technical issues were found with the discovery system."
