        comment: "âœ… TESTED: Successfully verified the profile popup functionality. Created a comprehensive backend test that confirms: 1) User creation via email signup works correctly, 2) Profile setup process functions properly with all required fields, 3) The /api/user/{user_id} endpoint returns complete user data with all fields needed for the profile popup, 4) The profile_complete flag is correctly set to true after providing all required profile information, 5) Users with complete profiles appear in discovery results, 6) The backend API provides all necessary data for the profile popup to function. The state variables (showProfilePopup, selectedProfileUser, and profilePopupContext) added to App.js should resolve the 'showProfilePopup is not defined' JavaScript error."
