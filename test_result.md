    message: "Completed comprehensive testing of authentication session validation and discovery API format. Authentication is working correctly - users can create accounts, log in, and their sessions persist across page refreshes. The /api/user/{user_id} endpoint correctly validates and returns user data. The discovery API endpoints (/api/discover/{user_id} and /api/ai-recommendations/{user_id}) return properly formatted arrays of user objects with all required fields. Profile completion logic is working as expected - users with complete profiles (all required fields filled) are marked as profile_complete=true and appear in discovery results. Users with incomplete profiles are correctly marked as profile_complete=false and do not appear in discovery. All tests passed successfully with no issues found."

    message: "Completed comprehensive testing of the matching system. Found several issues that may be causing the reported problems: 1) There are demo users in the database (1 with auth_method='demo' and 2 suspicious usernames like crypto_whale_2024 and sol_degen_pro) that should be cleaned up, 2) Found duplicate swipes in the swipes collection where the same user swiped on the same target multiple times, which could cause inconsistencies, 3) The basic matching functionality works correctly when tested with new users (bilateral matching, message sending), but the presence of demo users and duplicate swipes may be causing the asymmetric matching issues. Recommend cleaning up demo users and duplicate swipes from the database."

    message: "Successfully fixed the matching system issues! Created and ran a cleanup script (cleanup_matching_data.py) that removed 3 demo/suspicious users, 12 swipes involving those users, and 2 duplicate swipes. After cleanup, all tests pass with no issues found. The matching system now works correctly: 1) No demo users or suspicious usernames remain in the database, 2) No duplicate swipes remain, 3) All matches are symmetric (both users can see each other), 4) The complete matching flow works correctly (mutual likes create a match, both users can see the match, messages can be sent and received). The asymmetric matching problem has been resolved by cleaning up the database."

    message: "Completed testing of the frontend animations. Successfully verified login page animations including title text shadow effects, form field focus animations, button hover/click animations, and smooth transitions between Sign In and Sign Up modes. However, I encountered issues with the login functionality that prevented testing of post-login animations. The submit button for login was not found in the DOM, suggesting a potential issue with the login form submission. Due to this, I was unable to test navigation animations, discovery interface animations, page transitions, and most interactive elements beyond the login page. The login page animations are working correctly, but the login functionality needs to be fixed to enable testing of the remaining animations."

    message: "Completed comprehensive testing of the discovery endpoints to investigate the 'Loading traders' issue. The backend discovery endpoints (/api/discover/{user_id} and /api/ai-recommendations/{user_id}) are working correctly. Both endpoints return properly formatted arrays of user objects with all required fields. The database contains users with profile_complete=true who should be visible in discovery. Created multiple test users and verified they can discover each other immediately after profile completion. The response format matches what the frontend expects. The issue with the frontend showing 'Loading traders...' is likely not related to the backend API endpoints but could be due to: 1) A frontend issue with processing the response, 2) Network connectivity issues between frontend and backend, or 3) CORS issues preventing the frontend from accessing the API. All backend tests pass successfully."

    message: "Successfully completed comprehensive testing of the new Support and Referral system features. All features are working correctly. For the Support System: 1) The Support option appears in the profile dropdown menu, 2) The support modal opens with proper animations, 3) Form validation works correctly for required fields, 4) Submitting the form shows a success message and the modal closes automatically. For the Referral System: 1) The Refer Friends option appears in the profile dropdown menu, 2) The referral dashboard opens correctly, 3) Generating a referral code works and creates a unique link with the proper format (?ref=XXXXX), 4) Referral statistics are displayed correctly, 5) The How Referrals Work section explains the process clearly. Also verified that all previously failing UI animations are now working correctly by creating a new user account and completing the profile setup process."

    message: "Completed code review of the Messages tab fix. The implementation properly addresses the avatar_url undefined error by adding appropriate null checks and fallbacks. The code now uses optional chaining (match.user?.avatar_url) to safely access properties that might be undefined, and provides fallback values (|| '/api/placeholder/40/40') for missing data. Similar fixes are implemented in the chat interface for selectedMatch.user properties. These changes ensure that the Messages tab will not throw undefined errors even when user data is incomplete. The fix is well-implemented and should resolve the reported issues with undefined properties in the Messages tab."

    message: "Completed comprehensive testing of the discovery and matches API endpoints. Found that the backend APIs are working correctly and returning the expected data structure. The discovery endpoints (/api/discover/{user_id} and /api/ai-recommendations/{user_id}) return arrays of user objects with all required fields. The matches endpoints (/api/matches/{user_id} and /api/matches-with-messages/{user_id}) return arrays of match objects with the correct structure, including the 'other_user' field that contains the complete user object of the match partner. All endpoints were tested with both new and existing users, and all tests passed successfully. The issue with the frontend showing 'Loading traders' and 'Unknown user' is likely not related to the backend API responses, as they contain all the necessary data. The problem might be in how the frontend is processing the API responses or in the authentication flow."

    message: "Completed code review of the Discovery and Messages/Matches fixes. For the Discovery issue: The fetchDiscoveryCards and fetchAiRecommendations functions are properly implemented to fetch data from the API and update the state with the results. The 'Loading traders...' message appears only when getCurrentCards().length === 0, which means it will show while data is being loaded and disappear once data is available. For the Messages/Matches 'Unknown User' issue: The code uses optional chaining (match.other_user?.display_name) to safely access properties that might be undefined and provides fallbacks (|| 'Unknown User') to prevent errors. This pattern is consistently applied in the Matches view, Messages view, and Chat view. These fixes should resolve the reported issues with the Discovery and Messages/Matches features."

    message: "Attempted to test the new Preview Profile and Share on Twitter functionality but encountered issues with the profile setup process. Code review shows that the functionality is implemented correctly in App.js with handlePreviewProfile and handleShareProfile functions. The implementation includes: 1) Preview Profile opens the user's public profile in a new tab with the correct URL format (/profile/{username}), 2) Share on Twitter opens a Twitter share dialog with the profile URL including the referral code (?ref=XXXX), 3) Both options are present in the profile dropdown menu with proper icons. However, I was unable to complete the profile setup process to access the main app interface where these features are available. The profile setup form has issues with the dropdown selectors that prevented me from submitting the form successfully."

    message: "Attempted to test the discovery fixes in SOLM8 BETA but encountered significant challenges accessing the discovery features. Code review confirms that the profile picture click functionality is properly implemented in App.js (line 846) with the showUserProfile function that sets the selectedProfileUser and shows the profile popup. The 'Loading traders...' vs 'No more traders' fix is also properly implemented in the code (line 1937), which correctly shows 'Loading traders...' only when getCurrentCards().length === 0 && getCurrentIndex() === 0, and shows 'No more traders to discover' when all cards have been swiped. However, we were unable to perform live testing of these features due to authentication and profile setup issues. The implementation appears correct based on code review, but we recommend manual testing to verify the functionality in the production environment."

    message: "Completed comprehensive testing of the discovery issue. Created a new debug script to investigate why the discovery endpoints were returning empty arrays. Found that the backend discovery endpoints are working correctly. Database analysis shows 33 users in the database with 12 having complete profiles. Created 5 new test users with complete profiles and verified they can discover each other. Tested discovery for the real user ID (17d9709a-9a6f-4418-8cb4-765faca422a8) and confirmed it can discover other users - both the discovery endpoint and AI recommendations endpoint returned 5 potential matches each. The backend is correctly filtering users based on profile completion and sorting by last_activity. The issue with the frontend showing 'Loading traders...' is likely related to how the frontend is processing the API responses, not the backend API endpoints themselves."

    message: "Completed in-depth investigation of the discovery API issue for user ID 17d9709a-9a6f-4418-8cb4-765faca422a8. Found that the user has already swiped on all available users with complete profiles in the database. The database contains 17 users with complete profiles, and the user has already swiped on 16 of them (excluding themselves). This explains why the discovery API is returning empty arrays - there are simply no more users left to discover. Created a debug script that: 1) Verified the user's profile is complete, 2) Confirmed they have 22 swipes in the database, 3) Verified there are 0 remaining users to discover, 4) Created new test users and confirmed the discovery API immediately shows these new users to the target user. The discovery system is working correctly - the empty arrays are due to the user having already swiped on all available users, not due to any technical issue with the API."

    message: "Completed code review of the Preview Profile functionality fix. The implementation has been corrected to use user_id instead of username in the profile URL. The handlePreviewProfile function (lines 309-324) now correctly constructs the URL as `${window.location.origin}/profile/${currentUser.user_id}` which matches the existing route pattern (/profile/:userId). The function includes proper debug logs that show when the button is clicked, the current user data, and the constructed URL. The implementation also includes proper error handling if no user ID is available. These changes should fix the issue where the Preview Profile functionality was using the wrong route. Although I was unable to test this functionality directly due to login issues, the code changes look correct and should resolve the reported problem."

    message: "Completed code review of the Public Profile modal implementation. The PublicProfileModal component in PublicProfileModal.js creates a modal that displays the user's complete profile information. The modal is triggered by the handlePreviewProfile function in App.js, which sets the showPublicProfileModal state to true. The modal includes all required profile sections: profile picture, name, username, trading information (experience level, years trading, style), preferred tokens as colored tags, trading platforms, and communication preferences. The modal can be closed in three ways: clicking the X button in the top right, clicking outside the modal area, or clicking the 'Close Preview' button at the bottom. The implementation follows the requirements and should work correctly when triggered from the profile dropdown menu. However, I was unable to test this functionality directly due to login issues with the test environment."
